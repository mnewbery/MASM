# MASM
This repo contains:
* A tutorial which contains instructions to follow in order to complete tasks that will allow a report to be written
* A Capture-The-Flag report template; and
* A binary file that needs to be analysed and changed to complete the tutorial tasks.

## Demo binary file for reverse engineering
The binary file in this repo **output1.bin** was created with a Microsoft Windows based compiler. <br>
Below are a list of questions for this binary object, which will form the body of the **Capture the Flag** report

Find the answers to these questions
1. What address does the Portable Executable Signature start at?    
1. What is the value of the Portable Executable Signature?
1. What is the target Machine value?
1. How many sections does the binary say it has?                     
1. What is the Time Date Stamp in hex and the human readable value?
1. Where is the Symbol Table?

1. What is the Magic number?                                
1. What is the Linker Version?                   
1. What is the target Subsystem?
1. What else can be determined from the binary file, such as information about the machine that did the compiling?

And finally, without attempting to run it what does the code actually do?
